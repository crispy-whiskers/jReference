# Why did I make this project?
So it was really late at night and I was writing this paper but I had to cite like a billion articles. Now, the thing is, nearly all these articles are from international authors. With international authors come ridiculously long winded names that spit in the face of standard English proununciation and word structure conventions. I know a thing called noodletools exists, but I am NOT about to copy some Indian nerd's 25-letter last name that is apparently derived from his great grand uncle's British officer or the last names of 39 unlucky, dead Italian grandfathers who have had their name shamelessly slapped at the end of a lab assistant who sees daylight once a week.

# How does it work?
It's a web scraper. Retrieve webpage, poke the HTML a bit, pick bits out that you want, jamble it all together in the mess that is called APA style or MLA style.


# Is this really a useful project?
Nah.
Wow, its really late. I should probably stop writing this.
